# SmallBackgroundMover

This project is used to remove/move small images in a backgrounds directory. At the moment I'm filtering by <2000h & <2000w and >2000h & <2000w. These values are hardcoded.

I want to eventually include a scripting language or a small configuration file so different things can be configured. Right now it only scans a single hardcoded folder and moves things to a single hardcoded folder. This will change over time.

I'm also using the project to learn git/github.
